  [2 of 20]: What is the Difference Between a Terminal and a Shell?
    - Terminal: the environment in which you are issuing the Bash commands.
        - In the context of using Bash, a terminal is a text-based interface that allows users to input commands and receive text-based output from the operating system. It serves as a bridge between users and the underlying system, enabling tasks like running programs, managing files, and executing scripts through command-line instructions.
    - A terminal is a user interface that displays a command prompt, allowing users to input commands and see their output. A shell, like Bash, is the actual program that interprets these commands and communicates with the operating system to execute them. In essence, the terminal provides the interface, while the shell processes commands and manages system interactions.
